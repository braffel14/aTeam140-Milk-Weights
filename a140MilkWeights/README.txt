Other notes or comments to the grader:

To begin, you must import one or more CSV data files using the import button from the start up screen. The program will parse all files you import and load the database and will let you know when parsing is complete. From there, you can generate either a report for a specific farm by typing in that Farm's ID. The program will tell you if the farm is not in the database. There is similar behavior for generating an annual report for a chosen year. You can also generate a report for a range of dates using the date pickers on the home screen. This can be used to also generate a monthly report by selecting the start and end dates of a specific month. When you are finished, you can Export Data to CSV from the home screen. This will package all data in the database into a CSV file for you to save anywhere on your system with a name of your choice. This file can then be imported again on a later run of the program.

Screenshots (in the screenshot folder):
00 displays the home screen upon startup.
01 shows the alert box confirming a successful import.
02 shows the art box displaying an error in the import of a CSV file due to incomplete or improperly formatted data
03 shows an example of an annual report
04 shows an example of a farm report
05 shows an example of a date range report


Future work:
1: on the home screen I would replace the text box for generating a farm report with a drop down menu displaying all the farms in the database to choose from so the user does not have to know which farms are in the database and which are not
2: There is a bug in the farm report which forces you to exit the report and regenerate it after manually adding a purchase. In the future I would fix this so the report is dynamic and would automatically refresh upon addition of a new purchase.
